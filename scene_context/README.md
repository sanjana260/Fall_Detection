This module performs scene understanding on video frames to determine:
1) Indoor vs Outdoor classification
2) Fine-grained scene type (e.g., staircase, parking_lot, hospital_room, gymnasium/indoor, etc.)
3) A final aggregated scene classification for the entire video
4) It operates frame-by-frame in real time and also produces a final video-level decision using temporal averaging.
